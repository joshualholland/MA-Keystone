# Morgan Ashley Salon Website
Very busy Salon in Birmingham, AL

Dev Server: https://morgan-ashley-salon.herokuapp.com/

This site is powered by NextJS and Keystone. 

Next provides a server-side rendering React App which allows for quicker load times on pages
and better search-engine optimization. 

Keystone provides a great tool for managing content for the developer and the client. A client can change his own website with 
just a few clicks with no additional overhead to the developer.

SCSS was another powerful tool vital to the project giving a leaner CSS, variables to allowing strong relationships between 
selectors and mixins to create re-usable parts which all ensures the responsivity of the App. 

Project Collaborators:
